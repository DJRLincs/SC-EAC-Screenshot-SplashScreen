## ^^ all of the text above is from https://github.com/AlexFlipnote projects and is a good standard to have when giving python scripts to others.

4. Once you have installed requirements.txt, move all the stuff from inside "Move Files in This to a Preferred Space" to a folder that you can remember and find with ease.

5. Then, in rotate_screenshot_splash.py, change any references to a folder or location to the appropriate spaces for your system. 

6. Once checking all of youre locations press the start_Basic.bat.

# Makes the script Automatic OPTIONAL:

- now their is two Bat files still left over depending on youre prefrence

  - "RSI Launcher.bat" Boots the launcher normally with the script ran (You will need to edit the bat to double check its openning stuff in the right locations)

  - "RSIShaderWipeLaunch.bat" Boots the launcher with a shader wipe and a script ran (you will need to edit the bat file to double check its openning stuff in the right locations) 

- After you have edited them, right click on either one or both and create shortcuts for them. You can then move them to your desktop, remove your original RSI Launcher shortcut, and then go into the properties of the shortcuts and give them icons and edit their names to look identical to a normal boot.


Hope you enjoy it :I
