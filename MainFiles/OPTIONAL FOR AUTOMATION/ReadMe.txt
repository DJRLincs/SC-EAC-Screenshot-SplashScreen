Hello ;D
- John

so the idea of these two bat files is that they automatically are run when you start the launcher the way i do this is i have the two bat files as two seperate shortcuts with the images replaced with RSI Icon and Uninstall 

RSI Launcher for normal boot

RSI Uninstall for Shader Wipe


the only problem with these two files is i cant automate it to find the locations of the Python scripts and the location of the launcher as its a bat file and i dont have
as much experience with the type of code for command prompt so you must put in the locations manually into the bat file

if you need any help feel free to reach out to me on Need Support and i will try my best to give a hand automating youre boot
